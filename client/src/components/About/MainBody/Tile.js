                        <p>4. Since 1984, Computer Engineering division, now Computer Science and Engineering is committed to provide a supportive, friendly and challenging environment for teaching, learning and research. Throughout our Bachelors, Masters and Ph. D. programs, our education model focuses on providing breadth and depth of knowledge in a multitude of computing disciplines like computer architecture, databases, networks, embedded systems, real-time systems, software engineering, Data Analytics, Artificial intelligence etc. We strive to educate students as the next generation of engineers capable of becoming leaders in industry, government and academia. It is evident from the fact that all of our students get selected into topmost MNCs from campus placement itself and many of them opt for higher studies in world renowned institutes/universities both in India and abroad.

                        <p>The Department offers 04 Undergraduate (UG), 01 Postgraduate (PG) and Ph.D. Programmes. PG program M.Tech. (Computer Engineering) is for regular candidates of two years duration and for working professionals of three years duration. The UG programme was started in 1983, right from the inception of the Institute(formerly NSIT). The first PG programme in COE was started in the year 1999. UG programme B. Tech. in Computer Science and Engg. (Artificial Intelligence) has been commenced from the session 2019-20. B. Tech. programme in Computer Science and Engg. (Data Science) has been commenced from 2020-21. In addition, the Department also offers high quality research programmes at the doctoral level.
                        <p>To keep in pace with the current technological advancements, the UG curriculum has been modified recently with provision for revision/modifications as and when need, so that the students get a feel of what exactly is happening outside in the tech-world.
